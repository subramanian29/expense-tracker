- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 11 or higher)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for building the backend
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database

### Frontend Setup

## API Documentation

- The backend provides a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with. You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API endpoints.
- API endpoints include:
  - `GET /api/expenses` - Retrieve all expenses
  - `POST /api/expenses` - Create a new expense
  - `PUT /api/expenses/{id}` - Update an existing expense
  - `DELETE /api/expenses/{id}` - Delete an expense
